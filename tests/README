Test cases are in data/.

The format:
 * Each file is a sequence of cases, separated by lines of 40 '='.
 * Cases may contain comments, lines beginning with '###', which are
   ignored.
 * Excluding comments, a case consists of an optional attributes line;
   an input document; and an expected result.
 * An attributes line consists of 'ATTR ' followed by space-separated
   attributes.  It must be the first line of the case.  The possible
   attributes are
    * 'chomped': the input document should be interpreted without its
      final newline.
    * "X$impl": the case should be treated as xfail for implementation
      $impl.  E.g., 'Xhaskell' means the implementation 'haskell' is
      expected to fail on this case.
 * The input document is whatever text comes before the expected
   result.  There is no mechanism for escaping the separators,
   comments, and attributes lines of this format.
 * The expected result is either a line consisting of 10 '!', meaning
   a parse error, or a line of 10 '-' followed by a JSON document
   expressing the intended parse.
